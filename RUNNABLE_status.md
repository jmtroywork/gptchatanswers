What are the reasons an AWS Batch Job is stuck in RUNNABLE  status when the job definition requests GPUs?

When an AWS Batch job with GPU requests is stuck in the "RUNNABLE" status, there can be several reasons for this issue. Here are some common causes to consider:

1. Insufficient GPU resources: The AWS Batch compute environment you are using may not have enough available GPU resources to fulfill the job's request. Check the GPU capacity of your compute environment and ensure that it has sufficient resources to accommodate your job's requirements.

2. GPU resource allocation conflicts: It's possible that other jobs or tasks in the compute environment are already utilizing the available GPU resources, causing a conflict with your job's request. In such cases, AWS Batch may hold the job in the "RUNNABLE" status until sufficient GPU resources become available.

3. Incorrect job definition configuration: Verify that the job definition for your AWS Batch job is correctly configured to request GPUs. Ensure that you have specified the correct number of GPUs required and that the GPU resource requirement is properly defined in your job definition.

4. Limitations of the EC2 instance type: Certain EC2 instance types may have limited GPU availability or specific restrictions on GPU usage. Double-check that the instance type you are using for your compute environment supports GPU instances and that the job's GPU request aligns with the instance's capabilities.

5. Job queue configuration: Check the configuration of your job queue in AWS Batch. Make sure that the queue has the necessary GPU resources allocated to handle GPU-enabled jobs. Also, ensure that the priority of the job queue and the job itself is set appropriately, as this can affect job scheduling and execution.

6. AWS Batch service issues: In rare cases, there may be temporary service disruptions or issues with AWS Batch that can cause jobs to get stuck in the "RUNNABLE" status. You can check the AWS Service Health Dashboard or AWS support channels to see if there are any known issues affecting Batch at the moment.

If you have reviewed these potential causes and are still experiencing issues, it's recommended to reach out to AWS support for further assistance. They can help diagnose the problem specific to your AWS Batch setup and provide guidance for resolution.
