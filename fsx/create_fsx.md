# create FSX in the AWS console

Two security groups were created beforehand: FSx and launch-wizard-1

Go to FSX console and press "Create File system"

Select FSx for Lustre as the file system type.

File in the file system details as below. (note: I'm not sure if the default VPC security group is needed to be associated to the file system). Also I'm not sure if the file system needs to be in the same AZ as the EC2 instances that use it.

Do not set up the S3 data repostiory yet, we will set it up after the file system is created.

Then go to the Next page and press Create File System

It will take several minutes for the file system be become available. 

Create an S3 bucket to serve as the file system repostitory. The one I created is cw-fsx-test-jmt743 (s3 bucket names need to be globally unique)

Select the file system

Then open the data repostitory tab and press the "Create data repository association" button

On the create data repository association page, choose a file path name (anything you wish), enter the S3 URI, and leave the other settings to the defaults.  Then press the "Create" button at the bottom.

Create EC2 instances to test connection. Associate the FSx security group to the EC2. The EC2 has to be in the same VPC as the file system, but can be in a different Availibility Zone (AZ).  Importantly the FSx client needs to be installed on the EC2, see here for more information: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/install-lustre-client.html

For my tests I used Amazon Linux 2 EC2s.

The above steps worked in the console when using the AWS root login.  The AWS documentation hints that there may be issues with associating a file system to an s3 repository if using a different AWS console login with different permissions.
