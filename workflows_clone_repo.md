how do I set up credentials so a workflow in one github repository can clone or pull code from another repository in the same orgainzation?

To set up credentials so a workflow in one GitHub repository can clone or pull code from another repository within the same organization, you can use a GitHub Personal Access Token or deploy keys for authentication. Below are steps to set this up:

### Using GitHub Personal Access Token:

1. **Generate a Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to your GitHub account settings.
   - Select "Developer settings" -> "Personal access tokens" -> "Generate new token."
   - Ensure you give the token appropriate permissions like `repo` for full control of private repositories or more restricted access based on your requirements.
   - Copy the generated token.

2. **Add the Personal Access Token as a Secret**:
   - In the repository where you want to use the token, go to "Settings" -> "Secrets."
   - Click on "New repository secret" and name your secret (e.g., `ACCESS_TOKEN`).
   - Paste the Personal Access Token value into the secret.

3. **Modify Workflow YAML File**:
   - In your workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/main.yml`), add a step to use the access token.
   - For example, you might use the access token in a step to clone the other repository:
   
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Clone other repository
           run: |
             git clone https://<token>@github.com/<organization>/<other-repo>.git
           env:
             token: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
   ```

   Replace `<token>`, `<organization>`, and `<other-repo>` with the appropriate values.

### Using Deploy Keys:

1. **Generate a Deploy Key**:
   - Go to the repository where you want to clone code.
   - Navigate to "Settings" -> "Deploy keys."
   - Click on "Add deploy key" and follow the instructions to generate the key. Ensure you allow write access if you intend to push from the workflow.

2. **Add the Deploy Key to the Other Repository**:
   - Go to the repository you want to clone from.
   - Navigate to "Settings" -> "Deploy keys."
   - Click on "Add deploy key" and paste the public key generated from the previous step.

3. **Modify Workflow YAML File**:
   - In your workflow file, use the SSH URL for cloning the repository. GitHub automatically uses the deploy key for authentication when cloning using SSH.
   
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Clone other repository
           run: |
             git clone git@github.com:<organization>/<other-repo>.git
   ```

   Replace `<organization>` and `<other-repo>` with the appropriate values.

Choose the method that suits your requirements and follow the steps to set up the credentials for accessing the other repository within your GitHub Actions workflow.
